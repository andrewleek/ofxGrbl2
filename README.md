# ofxGrbl2
[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) addon for easily sending GCode commands to a device with [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/) firmware


This addon was at first a fork of https://github.com/TsubokuLab/ofxGrbl but then I refactored so heavily that I decided to make it a different addon.
